**_All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace_**

I like to think (and<br>
the sooner the better!)<br>
of a cybernetic meadow<br>
where mammals and computers<br>
live together in mutually<br>
programming harmony<br>
like pure water<br>
touching clear sky.

I like to think<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(right now, please!)<br>
of a cybernetic forest<br>
filled with pines and electronics<br>
where deer stroll peacefully<br>
past computers<br>
as if they were flowers<br>
with spinning blossoms.

I like to think<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(it has to be!)<br>
of a cybernetic ecology<br>
where we are free of our labors<br>
and joined back to nature,<br>
returned to our mammal<br>
brothers and sisters,<br>
and all watched over<br>
by machines of loving grace.
